## Dokan library
Get the Dokan installation from: https://github.com/joachimmetz/dokan

The Visual Studio project files expect the source directory to be named dokan and located in the directory containing the ${project_name}-```<version>``` directory.

Build the driver and install, see sys\howtobuild.txt in the dokan project for more information.

Change the "sys/public.h" file to include "windows.h" instead of "deviceioctl.h" after building the driver.  This is required for the Visual Studio build.

The Dokan library is now ready to be build from the ${project_name} Visual Studio solution file and will be named dokan.dll.
